# Welcome to MEDSL's Primary Data Archive

We are using this as a repository for primary elections data. We will eventually clean and standardize these data once they are certified and place them in our [permanent dataverse archive](http://electionlab.mit.edu/data). For now, the data come "as is" and as (unofficially) reported on election night by the various states.
