## Welcome to MEDSL's Primary Data Archive

We are using this as a respository for primary elections data. We will eventually clean and standardize these data and place them in our [permanent dataverse archive](http://electionlab.mit.edu/data). For now, the data come "as is" and as reported on election night by the various states.
